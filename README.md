# Bot or Not Mobile

Taking a look at the Ionic framework to create mobile apps. I have not created a mobile app previously. I heard about Ionic through friends, and noticed it used Gulp, SCSS, and AngularJS. I already use these technologies in web development, so I felt this was a good tool for me to learn Mobile Development.

At Hack Tennessee 7, my team and I created a simple game based on 'Hot or Not' (but used to collect circumstancial data). A person is shown a picture and they chose whether or not it is a human or a robot.

More to come...
